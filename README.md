# stat-133-fall2017
This is Sudarshan's repo for Stat 133 course at UC Berkeley during Fall 2017

I will be organizing my repo by folders where hw folder contains all my hw files

I will also be using both browser and my desktop for commits so you might see me as either Sudarshan or shrinisudi\
This repo is also under an organization which is titled **Sudarshan-UCB**
