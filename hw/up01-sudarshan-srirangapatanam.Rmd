**When to Use it?**\
This is a quick recipe that works consistently everytime, so I recommend using this when you have very little time and would like to make something in about 20-30 minutes. You can use it in any season with ingredients readily available at your local grocery store.

**Variations:** You can aslways try the same recipe with different kinds of pasta to give a slightly different flavor.

## Quadratic Equation

Quadratic equation is any equation with the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\
Here, a, b and c are coefficients that can take any real value such that $a \neq 0$.

To find the roots of the equations, i.e. x-intercepts or the values fo x for which the equation results in value 0, we can use quadratic formula for the roots:
$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

## Comments and Reflections

Keeping the paragraphs and line breaks organized took some time since the line breaks we are used to from word simply spits out a large paragraph of text. Even though I have used markdown before it took some time to get back to the flow, however, a new syntax that I learned is the use of *backslash* to indicate line breaks. Before this assignment I used to add double space which was hard to find when viewing the file in plain text mode, I can now find the line breaks much faster.

I used 2 links to help me with the assignment, the first resource was [R Markdown cheatsheet][2] to refresh my memory.
The other was for [latex notations][3] to find the notation for $\neq$ and $\pm$.
