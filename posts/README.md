## Posts

For the posts section of the class I will be writing about hypothesis tests.

My goal is to breifly introduce why we do hypothesis tests and to talk about the following:

* Z-tests
* T-tests
* Chi-squared tests or paired T-tests

I will also include a calculator function at the end of each post where a test will be performed using minimal amount of information required.
