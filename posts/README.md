## Posts

For the posts section of the class I will be writing about hypothesis tests.

**Pre-reqs**
These the concepts that I will not be dicussing and assume that the readers are already comfortable with:

+ Basic stats (mean, sd, expected number)
+ Distributions (normal distribution, t-distribution, chi-squared distribution)
+ Continious probabilities
+ Distinctions between samples and populations
+ Sampling and randomization
+ Estimating parameters

My goal is to breifly introduce why we do hypothesis tests and to talk about the following:

* Z-tests
* T-tests
* Chi-squared tests or paired T-tests

I will also include a calculator function at the end of each post where a test will be performed using minimal amount of information required.
