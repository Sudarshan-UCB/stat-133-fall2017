## Hypothesis Tests

**What are hypothesis tests?**

Hypothesis tests are a way to objectify differences within data. They help us measure defferences and tell us whether they are significant in an objective way.

Say you have two sample x and y. Sample x has a mean of 5 and sample y has a mean of 7. How can you objectively tell whether these two samples are actually different? This is where we do a hypothesis test and decide whether they are actrually different or if this was simply a difference due to random error.

**What do we need to do a hypothesis test?**
*\*Ingredients*

At the very least we need the following information to sucessfully run a test and be able to draw a reliable interpretation:

1. Information regarding sample:
  * Sample, or
  * Summary of sample, or
  * necessary Statistics regarding sample

2. Hypothesis:
  * A hypothesis that we belive is true based on knowledge regarding data, or
  * A hypothesis that we would want to reject

3. A test:
  * Test that would allow us accurately interpret results based on limitations of the sample

4. Acceptable error:
  * maximum allowed error, or
  * interpret based on p-value
  
## Testing scheme

**Step 1:** Construct hypothesis

**Step 2:** Decided on the test that is appropriate for the sample

**Step 3:** Gather necessary statistics from the sample

**Step 4:** Decide on acceptable error

**Step 5:** Execute the test
